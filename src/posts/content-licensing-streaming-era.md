# Content Licensing in the Streaming Era

The streaming revolution has transformed how content is licensed, distributed, and monetized. Having worked on content deals at both the Pac-12 and FuboTV, I've seen these changes from multiple perspectives.

## The New Deal Landscape

Traditional content licensing focused primarily on linear broadcast rights. Today's deals must address:

- Linear and streaming rights (often separately valued)
- FAST channel distribution
- On-demand libraries
- International territories
- Social media and clip rights

## Negotiation Strategies

### Understand Your Leverage

Content owners with exclusive, high-demand programming have significant negotiating power. But distribution platforms with large subscriber bases bring their own leverage to the table.

### Structure for Flexibility

The market moves quickly. Build in mechanisms for adjusting to changing consumption patterns and emerging platforms.

### Get the Data Rights Right

Viewership data, subscriber information, and engagement metrics are increasingly valuable. Clarify ownership and usage rights upfront.

## Common Pitfalls

Several issues frequently cause problems in content licensing deals:

1. **Ambiguous territory definitions** - Be precise about geographic scope
2. **Unclear platform definitions** - "Streaming" means different things to different parties
3. **Music licensing gaps** - Ensure all underlying rights are properly cleared
4. **Audit right limitations** - Robust audit provisions protect revenue

## Looking Ahead

As the streaming landscape continues to consolidate and evolve, content licensing will only become more complex. The attorneys and executives who master these nuances will be well-positioned to create value for their organizations.
